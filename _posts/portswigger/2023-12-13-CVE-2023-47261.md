# CVE-2023-47261

**Description**

Dokmee ECM through `7.4.6` allows remote code execution because the response to a `/#/gettingstarted` request contains a connection string for privileged SQL Server database access, and `xp_cmdshell` can be enabled to achieve full RCE on server.

Vulnerability Type  Remote Code Execution due to Sensitive data exposure in application response and exposed MSSQL service port.

To achieve RCE i found 0day to achieve the fourth 0day.

**Story**

After a lot of enumeration and fuzzing i couldn't find any interesting thing.

But wait go back to login page and got to http history in my burp and i catch and endpoint with setup button.

**Attack Vectors**

➜ Go to Login page 

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled.png?raw=true)

➜ Enter step back to endpoint `/#/gettingstarted` 

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%201.png?raw=true)

➜ Click setup then enter license but i don’t have a license. 
➜ After Trying dummy license but all trials fails.
➜ So i try to inject license with symbols as `\` to bypass license validation and it works success.

➜ OR enter any dummy data, then intercept the response and manipulate the response

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%202.png?raw=true)

➜ The connection strings to the database is returned in the response.
➜ Attacker get to step to setup to server 

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%204.png?raw=true)

➜ Enter any dummy data

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%205.png?raw=true)

➜ See the response 

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%206.png?raw=true)

➜ The attacker can use this information to complete the configuration.
➜ The SQL configuration is returned automatically in the response.
➜ Click "Next" to complete the configuration.

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%207.png?raw=true)

➜ The attacker can gain access to the Microsoft SQL server by using the found credentials.
➜ Go to Metasploit and `use auxiliary (scanner/MSSQL/msSQL_login)` and set this credential. Run the auxiliary module.

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%208.png?raw=true)

➜ After logging in, the attacker can use sqsh to connect to the database (also, the attacker can connect via Microsoft SQL Server Studio).
➜ After connecting to the database, the attacker can enable xp_cmdshell.

![Untitled](https://github.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%209.png?raw=true)

➜ The attacker can connect from Microsoft SQL server Studio and execute commands.

WOOOOW Finally RCE
