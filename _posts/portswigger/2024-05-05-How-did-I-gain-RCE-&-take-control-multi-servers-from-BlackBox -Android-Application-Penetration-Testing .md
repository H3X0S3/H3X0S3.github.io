Hi Hackers My name is Mahmoud Salah AKA H3X0S3, Offensive Security Engineer. In this article, I will explain how I got full DB access and then got RCE on the DB server. let’s start. It was Android application penetration test engagement.

At first, I tried to decompile the application and it wan not obfuscated and there noting was interesting, so list start to run the application of android device.

After running the application on device, i tried to intercept the requests using burpsuite.

Hmmmmmm, i find a Publish.rar and try to download it, WOW successfully download.

let's discover the files in comprised file.  
it contains  
1- dll files  
2- Blank HTML pages  
3- Packages
