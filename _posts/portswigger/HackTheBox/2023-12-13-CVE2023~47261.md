**Description**

Dokmee ECM version `7.4.6` allows remote code execution because the response to a `/#/gettingstarted` response contains a connection strings for privileged SQL Server database access, and `xp_cmdshell` can be enabled to achieve full RCE on server.

Vulnerability Type  Remote Code Execution due to Sensitive data exposure in application response and exposed MSSQL service port.

To achieve RCE i found 0day to achieve the fourth 0day.

 **Tools**


| Tool Name  |  Usage |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  **Metasploit** |   has a built-in module named mssql_login, which we can use as an authentication tester for brute-forcing the username and password of an MSSQL server database.|
|  **Crackmapexec** |   can use as an authentication tester for brute-forcing the username and password of an MSSQL server database.|
|  **Impact** |   can use as an authentication tester for brute-forcing the username and password of an MSSQL server database.|
|  **SQSH** |  can use as an authentication with the username and password of an MSSQL server database.|
|  **Microsoft SQL server Studio** |  can use as an authentication with the username and password of an MSSQL server database form management.|
 


**Story**

After a lot of enumeration and fuzzing i couldn't find any interesting thing.

But wait go back to login page and got to http history in my burp and i catch and endpoint with setup button.

**Attack Vectors**

➜ Go to Login page 

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%201.png)



➜ Enter step back to endpoint `/#/gettingstarted` 

➜ Click setup then enter license but i don’t have a license. 

➜ After Trying dummy license but all trials fails.

➜ So i try to inject license with symbols as `\` to bypass license validation and it works success.

➜ OR enter any dummy data, then intercept the response and manipulate the response

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%203.png)

➜ The connection strings to the database is returned in the response.

➜ Attacker get to step to setup to server

➜ Enter any dummy data

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%205.png)

➜ See the response 

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%206.png)

➜ The attacker can use this information to complete the configuration.

➜ The SQL configuration is returned automatically in the response.

➜ Click "Next" to complete the configuration.

➜ The attacker can gain access to the Microsoft SQL server by using the found credentials.

➜ Go to Metasploit and `use auxiliary (scanner/MSSQL/msSQL_login)` and set this credential. Run the auxiliary module you can use crackmapexec or impacket.

➜ After logging in, the attacker can use sqsh to connect to the database (also, the attacker can connect via Microsoft SQL Server Studio).

➜ After connecting to the database, the attacker can enable xp_cmdshell.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/H3X0S3/h3x0s3.github.io/main/assets/img/CVE/Untitled%209.png)

➜ The attacker can connect from Microsoft SQL server Studio and execute commands.

WOOOOW Finally RCE
